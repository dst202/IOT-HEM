# IOT Home Energy Monitor

The idea of project is to design simple low cost Energy onsumption monitor for home by leveraging measurement techniques of **VOLTAGE, CURRENT, POWER,  POWERFACTOR  and  ENERGY**

Thus combining skill like Programming with C on Microcontrollers , Edge monitoring using API and PCB design skills.

Each part of project is designed **One** of the **3 group** members.

___

*Project development is as follows:*

1. Devlopement and Simulation of **VOLTAGE** measuremnt circuit

2. Devlopement and Simulation of **CURRENT** measuremnt circuit

3. Devlopement and Simulation of **Power Factor** measuremnt circuit

4. Design and Assembly of entire circuit on **zero PCB**

5. Programming Arduino UNO to calculate **POWER** and **ENERGY**

6. Display of measuremenrs on LCD Display

7. Sending data to cloud using **Thingspeak**
