# Energy-Monitoring-Control-and-automatic-Billing-of-house-using-ARDUINO_IOT


An implementation of IOT based home energy monitoring system is
proposed to minimize the energy consumption cost in terms of effective
utilization of household electric appliances. In real time application
increasing the cost of power consumption plays a vital role in chaotic
financial management. Moreover, due to modern life style and economic
status of the family urge to use of more powered appliances without
consciously considering the effects of over utility. Hence, monitoring and
control of power utilities are utmost priority. This is intended to develop a
home energy monitoring device, which is based on microcontroller that
monitors the power consumption of each device at home and gives a
detailed report. This can be viewed over IOT connected devices as well
as it stores this data. This provides the consumer an idea how the power
being consumed and help them to reduce it. However, everyone wishes
to save the energy and money to reach their targets. Hence, minimizing
the monthly electricity bill is a good place to start. On the other hand, not
only for household appliances it can be used in small scale industries.
To evaluate the proposed technique a prototype hardware model to be
developed with IOT based Arduino. This system will gives satisfactory
performance in the real time applications.

This is done as a Bachelors project by me along with two more classmates.
