# IOT Home Energy Monitor

The idea of project is to design simple low cost Energy onsumption monitor for home by leveraging measurement techniques of **VOLTAGE, CURRENT, POWER,  POWERFACTOR  and  ENERGY**

Thus combining skill like Programming with C on Microcontrollers , Edge monitoring using API and PCB design skills.

Each part of project is designed **One** of the **3 group** members.

___
